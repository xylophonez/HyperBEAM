%%% @doc A key-value store implementation, following the `hb_store' behavior 
%%% and interface. This implementation utilizes the node's local file system as
%%% its storage mechanism, offering an alternative to other store's that require
%%% the compilation of additional libraries in order to function.
%%% 
%%% As this store implementation operates using Erlang's native `file' and 
%%% `filelib' mechanisms, it largely inherits its performance characteristics 
%%% from those of the underlying OS/filesystem drivers. Certain filesystems can
%%% be quite performant for the types of workload that HyperBEAM AO-Core execution
%%% requires (many reads and writes to explicit keys, few directory 'listing' or
%%% search operations), awhile others perform suboptimally.
%%% 
%%% Additionally, thisstore implementation offers the ability for simple 
%%% integration of HyperBEAM with other non-volatile storage media: `hb_store_fs'
%%% will interact with any service that implements the host operating system's
%%% native filesystem API. By mounting devices via `FUSE' (etc), HyperBEAM is
%%% able to interact with a large number of existing storage systems (for example,
%%% S3-compatible cloud storage APIs, etc).
