%%% @doc This module is the root of the device call logic of the 
%%% AO-Core protocol in HyperBEAM.
%%% 
%%% At the implementation level, every message is simply a collection of keys,
%%% dictated by its `Device', that can be resolved in order to yield their
%%% values. Each key may contain a link to another message or a raw value:
%%% 
%%% 	`ao(BaseMessage, RequestMessage) -> {Status, Result}'
%%% 
%%% Under-the-hood, `AO-Core(BaseMessage, RequestMessage)' leads to a lookup of
%%% the `device' key of the base message, followed by the evaluation of
%%% `DeviceMod:PathPart(BaseMessage, RequestMessage)', which defines the user 
%%% compute to be performed. If `BaseMessage' does not specify a device, 
%%% `~message@1.0' is assumed. The key to resolve is specified by the `path' 
%%% field of the message.
%%% 
%%% After each output, the `HashPath' is updated to include the `RequestMessage'
%%% that was executed upon it.
%%% 
%%% Because each message implies a device that can resolve its keys, as well
%%% as generating a merkle tree of the computation that led to the result,
%%% you can see the AO-Core protocol as a system for cryptographically chaining 
%%% the execution of `combinators'. See `docs/ao-core-protocol.md' for more 
%%% information about AO-Core.
%%% 
%%% The `key(BaseMessage, RequestMessage)' pattern is repeated throughout the 
%%% HyperBEAM codebase, sometimes with `BaseMessage' replaced with `Base', `M1'
%%% or similar, and `RequestMessage' replaced with `Req', `M2', etc.
%%% 
%%% The result of any computation can be either a new message or a raw literal 
%%% value (a binary, integer, float, atom, or list of such values).
%%% 
%%% Devices can be expressed as either modules or maps. They can also be 
%%% referenced by an Arweave ID, which can be used to load a device from 
%%% the network (depending on the value of the `load-remote-devices' and
%%% `trusted-device-signers' environment settings).
%%% 
%%% HyperBEAM device implementations are defined as follows:
%%% <pre>
%%%     DevMod:ExportedFunc : Key resolution functions. All are assumed to be
%%%                           device keys (thus, present in every message that
%%%                           uses it) unless specified by `DevMod:info()'.
%%%                           Each function takes a set of parameters
%%%                           of the form `DevMod:KeyHandler(Base, Req, Opts)'.
%%%                           Each of these arguments can be ommitted if not
%%%                           needed. Non-exported functions are not assumed
%%%                           to be device keys.
%%%
%%%     DevMod:info : Optional. Returns a map of options for the device. All 
%%%                   options are optional and assumed to be the defaults if 
%%%                   not specified. This function can accept a `Base' as 
%%%                   an argument, allowing it to specify its functionality 
%%%                   based on a specific message if appropriate.
%%% 
%%%     info/exports : Overrides the export list of the Erlang module, such that
%%%                   only the functions in this list are assumed to be device
%%%                   keys. Defaults to all of the functions that DevMod 
%%%                   exports in the Erlang environment.
%%%
%%%     info/excludes : A list of keys that should not be resolved by the device,
%%%                     despite being present in the Erlang module exports list.
%%% 
%%%     info/handler : A function that should be used to handle _all_ keys for 
%%%                    messages using the device.
%%% 
%%%     info/default : A function that should be used to handle all keys that
%%%                    are not explicitly implemented by the device. Defaults to
%%%                    the `dev_message' device, which contains general keys for 
%%%                    interacting with messages.
%%% 
%%%     info/default_mod : A different device module that should be used to
%%%                    handle all keys that are not explicitly implemented
%%%                    by the device. Defaults to the `dev_message' device.
%%% 
%%%     info/grouper : A function that returns the concurrency 'group' name for
%%%                    an execution. Executions with the same group name will
%%%                    be executed by sending a message to the associated process
%%%                    and waiting for a response. This allows you to control 
%%%                    concurrency of execution and to allow executions to share
%%%                    in-memory state as applicable. Default: A derivation of
%%%                    Base+Req. This means that concurrent calls for the same
%%%                    output will lead to only a single execution.
%%% 
%%%     info/worker : A function that should be run as the 'server' loop of
%%%                   the executor for interactions using the device.
%%% 
%%% The HyperBEAM resolver also takes a number of runtime options that change
%%% the way that the environment operates:
%%% 
%%% `update_hashpath':  Whether to add the `Req' to `HashPath' for the `Res'.
%%% 					Default: true.
%%% `add_key':          Whether to add the key to the start of the arguments.
%%% 					Default: `<not set>'.
%%% </pre>
